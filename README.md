This social meda project called "social wave" is made by using Bootstrap and SASS. 

I have changed the $primary color in this project, and made some other changes to the projects already existing colors. 

I have used both .p and .m-classes from bootstrao to handle padding and margin, and also used the nav-bar component. 

The logo i have made myselv, and then implementet its color theme in the rest of the project, and also added the logo in the nav on each page. 

On the authentication page i did have a button which worked fine when it comes to form-authentication, but i did have some trouble to get sent to the feed.html page when clicking on the button, therefore i have commented that button out (so that you can see that it works with the authentication), but i added an a href insted to get sent to the feed.html page.
